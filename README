Some applications are very hard to run as windows service, for example, Thin ruby web server. When you start your web application run by Thin server, the console is blocked until Ctrl+c is pressed. In an automation deployment environment, it is very hard to stop the application through command line. Use RunProcessAsService, you can just set RunProcessAsService.exe.config to specify the excecutable path and arguments and then install the RunProcessAsService.exe as a windows service. When you start the service, your excecutable will be started. When you stop the service, the excecutalb will be stopped. I use it to deploy my Thin web applications as windows services and it works.
